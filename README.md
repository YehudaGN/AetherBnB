## Challenges 
- In order to have the option to search for listings by a city, but also to have the option to just search through all the listings, I decided to add optional data to the backend containing the search params. If the params contained a city, I would fetch all the listings with that city. If the params did not contain a city, I would fetch all the listings.

```
def index 
    if !params[:searchParams]     
        @listings = Listing.with_attached_photos.all    
    elsif params[:searchParams][:city]
       @listings = Listing.with_attached_photos.where(city: params[:searchParams][:city])
    end
    render :index
end 
 ```
